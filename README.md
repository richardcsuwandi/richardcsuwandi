I am a PhD student at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), advised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tsunghuichang). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BSc degree in Statistics from CUHK-Shenzhen.

I am interested in building [open-ended]() intelligent systems capable of continuous learning, efficient knowledge acquisition from limited data, and generalization across an evolving range of tasks. To this end, my research explores:

- **Bayesian optimization** for sample-efficient, adaptive exploration in open-ended search spaces
- **Gaussian processes** to enable principled decision-making and uncertainty quantification
- **Foundation models** for open-ended algorithm discovery, creative problem solving, and generative design in science and engineering

During my free time, I also enjoy [writing](https://richardcsuwandi.github.io/blog/) about the latest advancements in AI. If you are interested in collaborating or discussing research ideas, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:richardsuwandi@link.cuhk.edu.cn).
