<h1 align="center">Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40px"></h1>

I am a PhD student at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), advised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tsunghuichang). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BSc degree in Statistics from CUHK-Shenzhen.

I am a PhD student majoring in Computer and Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), advised by Prof. Feng Yin and Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BSc in Statistics from CUHK-Shenzhen. 

My current research explores:
- **Bayesian optimization** for sample-efficient black-box optimization and sequential decision-making
- **Gaussian processes** for probabilisitic modeling and uncertainty quantification
- **Foundation models** for open-ended algorithm discovery and generative design in science & engineering

During my free time, I also enjoy [writing](https://richardcsuwandi.github.io/blog/) about the latest advancements in AI. If you are interested in collaborating or discussing research ideas, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:richardsuwandi@link.cuhk.edu.cn).
